# Segmentation_using_Clusters

This is an example of using clustering - an unsupervised learning technique - to create clusters of individuals who behave similarily for marketing and "customer segmentation" purposes.

Once the clusters are made then it is necessary to communicate the results of the clusters and provide to the client an idea of what makes the clusters different.
